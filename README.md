# Image Comparison with OpenCV and SSIM

This project demonstrates how to compare two images using Python's OpenCV library and the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) on Google Colab. It helps visualize and identify differences between two input images.

## Features
- **Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)**: Calculates how similar two images are, with a score between -1 and 1.
- **Thresholding**: Highlights and visualizes the differences between two images.
- **User-Friendly Visuals**: Displays the two images side by side along with a difference map.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:

1. Google Colab (or Python 3.6+ environment with required libraries installed).
2. Python libraries:
   - `opencv-python`
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `scikit-image`

You can install these libraries using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib scikit-image
